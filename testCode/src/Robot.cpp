 *                         ROBOT LOAD ORDER                                    *
 * The Robot Load Order (RLO for short), is how the robot switches from one    *
 * mode to another (E.X: Autonomous -> Teleop).                                *
 *                                                                             *
 * The RLO (after Calling START_ROBOT_CLASS) is as follows:                    *
 *                                                                             *
 * Constructor -> RobotInit -> DisabledInit -> DisabledPeriodic                *
 *                                                                             *
 *                                                                             *
 * When the robot wants to change modes, here is how it does it:               *
 *                                                                             *
 * CurrentMode(Periodic) -> NextMode(Init) -> NextMode(Periodic)               *
 *                                                                             *
 *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  */
